TL;DR:

 - Task switch frequently.  Do 2 or 3 things at once if it's productive.  Walk and chew gum at the same time.
 - Diversify tasks and mediums.  Treat them like the stocks in your retirement fund.  Or the clothes in your closet, you want to be able to mix and match.
 - Invest in work environments.  Chairs.  Monitors.
 - Pay someone to do your chores.
 - Retrospect.  Optimize.  Repeat.
 - Plan for reusability.  What you produce will get leveraged in different mediums by different stakeholders.  Work once, use many.
 - Have a vision of how products will get re-leveraged.  Do the small, easy piece first.  Minimum Viable Product.
 - Work evenings, weekends, holidays.
 - Stay healthy.
 - Talk with your significant other.  Develop a shared vision.  Accept shared sacrifice.  Enjoy shared rewards.
 - If you're good at code, differentiate by working on communication and influence.
