Ever since XKCD came out with the `correct horse battery staple` I've moved to using passphrases everywhere.

Now that I've got kids I use them for homework assignments that I generate mere moments before they get off the bus.  They need to practice reading, writing, and arithmatic.

Here's a passphrase generator using the "ten hundred" most popular words that Randall Munroe used in his [Thing Explainer](https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/) book.

<passphrase style="font-family:monospace;white-space:pre;font-size:xx-large;">huh ever able clothes</passphrase>
<input type="button" onload="nextPassphrase()" onclick="nextPassphrase()" value="Next">
