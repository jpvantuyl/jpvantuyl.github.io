  * Subhash sent a nice note to Steve:

            Hello Steve,

            I am not writing something which you already don’t know. I had the privilege of working with John for couple of months. He has left a long lasting impression on me.  His technical expertise is superb with a very wide range. He looks for opportunities to automate and goes next step to make sure it is done right. John’s scripting skills are amazing and does lot of DevOps work. There were times I felt like he can do multiple roles BA, PM, DevOps better than individuals in the role.

            John is truly a patient listener. This is one skill I have been trying to improve so I know the pain of keeping mum when you know so much. I have been in many meetings in which even speaker forgot what was said but luckily John recapped point by point in a better way. I remember many pairing opportunities when he says out loud for me whenever every short key he pressed and not leaving any room for further questioning. I have been a believer that multitasking can’t be done right but John proved me wrong.

            I can go on and on.. most importantly John is truly a team player. I hope I will get to pair with him in future. There are so many technical and soft skills to learn from him. I learn by taking inspiration from people around you.

  * Got blog dependencies updated for Ruby via WSL
